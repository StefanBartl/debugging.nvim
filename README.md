One `:Debug {category} {action}` command for every Neovim debugging tool.

Debugging tools accumulate as scattered one-off commands, each with a name you
have to remember before you can use it. This plugin puts all of them behind a
single dispatcher with two-level tab completion, so the surface is discoverable
rather than memorised.

## Documentation

Start at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) — what's where, and which question
each page answers.

**The Basics**

- [Requirements](docs/installation.md#requirements) — Neovim version, required and optional plugins.
- [Installation](docs/installation.md) — every plugin manager, and what lazy-loading costs.
- [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) — the first thing to run after installing.

**Configuration**

- [What you get with the defaults](docs/what-you-get.md) — the commands that matter on day one.
- [All options](docs/configuration.md) — every `setup()` option and its default.
- [Command reference](docs/commands.md) — every category and action, with completion behaviour.
- [Bindings cheatsheet](docs/BINDINGS.md) — every keymap, user command and autocommand in one table.

**The Rest**

- [Features](docs/FEATURES/README.md) — what each group of `:Debug` categories does, and why it works that way.
- [Around it](docs/around-it.md) — how this plugin's scope differs from its siblings in the collection.
- [Workflow](docs/WORKFLOW.md) — which category to reach for when, and the gotchas in each.
- [Diagnosing UI freezes](docs/troubleshooting.md) — using `:Debug proc` to trace blocking calls and hung child processes.
- [Health check](docs/commands.md#health-check) — what `:checkhealth debugging` reports.
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) — module layout and the dispatcher's shape.
- [Contributing](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) — ground rules and project layout.
- [Feedback](https://github.com/StefanBartl/debugging.nvim/issues) — bug reports, feature requests, and open-ended questions.

`:help debugging` is the same reference inside the editor.
